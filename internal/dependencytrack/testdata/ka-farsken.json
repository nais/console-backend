      "description": "### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n`node-tar` aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. \n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1\n\nNOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address CVE-2021-32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.\n\n```js\nconst path = require('path')\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  // either add this function...\n  onentry: (entry) => {\n    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n      entry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)\n      entry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)\n    }\n  },\n\n  // or this one\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.",

      "description": "### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n`node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks.  Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur.\n\nBy first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.\n\nThis issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.3 || 4.4.15 || 5.0.7 || 6.1.2\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `filter` method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.\n\n```js\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.",

      "description": "### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\nnode-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory.\n\nThis logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`.  If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory.\n\nAdditionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path.\n\nThis only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems.\n\n### Patches\n\n4.4.18 || 5.0.10 || 6.1.9\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does.\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.\n\n### Fix\n\nThe fixed versions strip path roots from all paths prior to being resolved against the extraction target folder, even if such paths are not \"absolute\".\n\nAdditionally, a path starting with a drive letter and then two dots, like `c:../`, would bypass the check for `..` path portions.  This is checked properly in the patched versions.\n\nFinally, a defense in depth check is added, such that if the `entry.absolute` is outside of the extraction taret, and we are not in preservePaths:true mode, a warning is raised on that entry, and it is skipped.  Currently, it is believed that this check is redundant, but it did catch some oversights in development.\n",

      "description": "### Impact\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\nnode-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained two directories and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include directories with two forms of the path that resolve to the same file system entity, followed by a symbolic link with a name in the first form, lastly followed by a file using the second form. It led to bypassing node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.\n\nThe v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.\n\n### Patches\n\n6.1.9 || 5.0.10 || 4.4.18\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.\n\n```js\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.\n\n#### Fix\n\nThe problem is addressed in the following ways, when comparing paths in the directory cache and path reservation systems:\n\n1. The `String.normalize('NFKD')` method is used to first normalize all unicode to its maximally compatible and multi-code-point form.\n2.

      "description": "### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n`node-tar` aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. \n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1\n\nNOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address CVE-2021-32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.\n\n```js\nconst path = require('path')\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  // either add this function...\n  onentry: (entry) => {\n    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n      entry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)\n      entry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)\n    }\n  },\n\n  // or this one\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.",

An attacker could cause denial of service\nand execution of arbitrary code when a crafted image file is\nprocessed.\n\n\n* [CVE-2017-14528](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14528)\nThe TIFFSetProfiles function in coders/tiff.c has incorrect\n expectations about whether LibTIFF TIFFGetField return values\n imply that data validation has occurred, which allows remote\n attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free after an\n invalid call to TIFFSetField, and application crash) via a crafted\n file.\n* [CVE-2020-19667](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-19667)\nStack-based buffer overflow and unconditional jump in ReadXPMImage\n in coders/xpm.c\n* [CVE-2020-25665](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25665)\nThe PALM image coder at coders/palm.c makes an improper call to\n AcquireQuantumMemory() in routine WritePALMImage() because it\n needs to be offset by 256. This can cause a out-of-bounds read\n later on in the routine. This could cause impact to reliability.\n* [CVE-2020-25674](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-25674)\nWriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for\n loop with an improper exit condition that can allow an\n out-of-bounds READ via heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because\n it is possible for the colormap to have less than 256 valid values\n but the loop condition will loop 256 times, attempting to pass\n invalid colormap data to the event logger.\n* [CVE-2020-27560](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27560)\nImageMagick allows Division by Zero in OptimizeLayerFrames in\n MagickCore/layer.c, which may cause a denial of service.\n* [CVE-2020-27750](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27750)\nA flaw was found in MagickCore/colorspace-private.h and\n MagickCore/quantum.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that\n is processedcould trigger undefined behavior in the form of values\n outside the range of type `unsigned char` and math division by\n zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application\n availability, but could potentially cause other problems related\n to undefined behavior.\n* [CVE-2020-27760](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27760)\nIn `GammaImage()` of /MagickCore/enhance.c, depending on the\n `gamma` value, it's possible to trigger a divide-by-zero condition\n when a crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This could\n lead to an impact to application availability.\n* [CVE-2020-27763](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27763)\nA flaw was found in MagickCore/resize.c. An attacker who submits a\n crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger\n undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This\n would most likely lead to an impact to application availability,\n but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined\n behavior.\n* [CVE-2020-27765](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27765)\nA flaw was found in MagickCore/segment.c. An attacker who submits\n a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger\n undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This\n would most likely lead to an impact to application availability,\n but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined\n behavior.\n* [CVE-2020-27773](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-27773)\nA flaw was found in MagickCore/gem-private.h. An attacker who\n submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could\n trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range\n of type `unsigned char` or division by zero. This would most\n likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could\n potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.\n* [CVE-2020-29599](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-29599)\nImageMagick mishandles the -authenticate option, which allows\n setting a password for password-protected PDF files. The\n user-controlled password was not properly escaped/sanitized and it\n was therefore possible to inject additional shell commands via\n coders/pdf.c.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u11.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of imagemagick please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/imagemagick>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.

      "description": "The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.",

      "description": "### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n`node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems.\n\nBy first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.\n\nAdditionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems.  If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.  A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. \n\nThese issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7.\n\nThe v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.\n\n### Patches\n\n4.4.16 || 5.0.8 || 6.1.7\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.\n\n```js\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.\n\n### Fix\n\nThe problem is addressed in the following ways:\n\n1. All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing `\\` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving `\\` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed.\n2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.\n\n#### Caveat\n\nNote that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.\n\nUsers are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another.",

      "description": "The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14, and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due to insufficient absolute path sanitization. node-tar aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.",

      "description": "\nTwo issues have been discovered in python2.7:\n\n\n* [CVE-2021-3177](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3177)\nPython has a buffer overflow in PyCArg\\_repr in \\_ctypes/callproc.c, which may\n lead to remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept\n floating-point numbers as untrusted input.\n* [CVE-2021-4189](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4189)\nA flaw was found in Python, specifically in the FTP (File Transfer Protocol)\n client library when using it in PASV (passive) mode. The flaw lies in how\n the FTP client trusts the host from PASV response by default. An attacker\n could use this flaw to setup a malicious FTP server that can trick FTP\n clients into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This could lead\n to FTP client scanning ports which otherwise would not have been possible.\n .\n Instead of using the returned address, ftplib now uses the IP address we're\n already connected to. For the rare user who wants an old behavior, set a\n `trust\\_server\\_pasv\\_ipv4\\_address` attribute on your `ftplib.FTP` instance to\n True.\n\n\nFor Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.7.13-2+deb9u6.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of python2.7 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python2.7>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",

The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send\n content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent.\n This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input,\n thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n* [CVE-2023-27535](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-27535)\nAn authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in the FTP\n connection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being used\n during subsequent transfers.

When\n the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can\n cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy\n (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious\n requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not\n see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache\n key of an unkeyed parameter.\n\n\n**Attention, API-change!** \n\n\n Please be sure your software is working properly if it uses `urllib.parse.parse\\_qs`\n or `urllib.parse.parse\\_qsl`, `cgi.parse` or `cgi.parse\\_multipart`.\n\n\nEarlier Python versions allowed using both ``;`` and ``&`` as query parameter\n separators in `urllib.parse.parse\\_qs` and `urllib.parse.parse\\_qsl`.\n Due to security concerns, and to conform with\n newer W3C recommendations, this has been changed to allow only a single\n separator key, with ``&`` as the default.

This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory.\n\nThis logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\path`.  If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\extraction\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory.\n\nAdditionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path.\n\nThis only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems.\n\n### Patches\n\n4.4.18 || 5.0.10 || 6.1.9\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does.\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.\n\n### Fix\n\nThe fixed versions strip path roots from all paths prior to being resolved against the extraction target folder, even if such paths are not \"absolute\".\n\nAdditionally, a path starting with a drive letter and then two dots, like `c:../`, would bypass the check for `..` path portions.  This is checked properly in the patched versions.\n\nFinally, a defense in depth check is added, such that if the `entry.absolute` is outside of the extraction taret, and we are not in preservePaths:true mode, a warning is raised on that entry, and it is skipped.  Currently, it is believed that this check is redundant, but it did catch some oversights in development.\n",

      "description": "The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.",

When the\n attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (`;`), they can\n cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy\n (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in\n malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would\n usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not\n include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.\n* [CVE-2022-0391](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0391)\nThe `urlparse` module helps break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings into\n components. The issue involves how the urlparse method does not sanitize\n input and allows characters like `'\\r'` and `'\\n'` in the URL path. This flaw\n allows an attacker to input a crafted URL, leading to injection attacks.\n* [CVE-2022-48560](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-48560)\nA use-after-free exists in Python via `heappushpop` in `heapq`.\n* [CVE-2022-48565](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-48565)\nAn XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Python. The `plistlib`\n module no longer accepts entity declarations in XML plist files to avoid\n XML vulnerabilities.\n* [CVE-2022-48566](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-48566)\nAn issue was discovered in `compare_digest` in `Lib/hmac.py` in Python.\n Constant-time-defeating optimisations were possible in the accumulator\n variable in `hmac.compare_digest`.\n* [CVE-2023-24329](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-24329)\nAn issue in the `urlparse` component of Python allows attackers to bypass\n blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.\n* [CVE-2023-40217](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-40217)\nThe issue primarily affects servers written in Python (such as HTTP\n servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is\n created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly,\n there is a brief window where the `SSLSocket` instance will detect the socket\n as not connected and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will\n still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be\n authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate\n authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data\n is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS\n connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the\n vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on\n initialization of the `SSLSocket`.)\n\n\nFor Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version\n2.7.16-2+deb10u3.\n\n\nWe recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.\n\n\nFor the detailed security status of python2.7 please refer to\nits security tracker page at:\n<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python2.7>\n\n\nFurther information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply\nthese updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be\nfound at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>\n\n\n",

      "description": "### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n`node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems.\n\nBy first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.\n\nAdditionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems.  If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.  A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. \n\nThese issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7.\n\nThe v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.\n\n### Patches\n\n4.4.16 || 5.0.8 || 6.1.7\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.\n\n```js\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.\n\n### Fix\n\nThe problem is addressed in the following ways:\n\n1. All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing `\\` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving `\\` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed.\n2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.\n\n#### Caveat\n\nNote that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.\n\nUsers are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another.",

      "description": "### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n`node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks.  Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur.\n\nBy first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.\n\nThis issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.\n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.3 || 4.4.15 || 5.0.7 || 6.1.2\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `filter` method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.\n\n```js\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.",

      "description": "### Impact\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\nnode-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained two directories and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include directories with two forms of the path that resolve to the same file system entity, followed by a symbolic link with a name in the first form, lastly followed by a file using the second form. It led to bypassing node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.\n\nThe v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.\n\n### Patches\n\n6.1.9 || 5.0.10 || 4.4.18\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.\n\n```js\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.\n\n#### Fix\n\nThe problem is addressed in the following ways, when comparing paths in the directory cache and path reservation systems:\n\n1. The `String.normalize('NFKD')` method is used to first normalize all unicode to its maximally compatible and multi-code-point form.\n2. All slashes are normalized to `/` on Windows systems (on posix systems, `\\` is a valid filename character, and thus left intact).\n3. When a symbolic link is encountered on Windows systems, the entire directory cache is cleared.  Collisions related to use of 8.3 short names to replace directories with other (non-symlink) types of entries may make archives fail to extract properly, but will not result in arbitrary file writes.\n",
